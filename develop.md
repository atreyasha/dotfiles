## Tasks

### Dotfiles

1.  Current

    1.  emacs: improve autocompletions of latex layer:
        <https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/14134>

        1.  if possible, try to merge upstream changes to latex layer

        2.  wrong order of company-completions -\> brute-force solution
            is to create new layer

        3.  lighter solution is to modify `company-backends`{.verbatim}
            variable post-initialization -\> perhaps with advice over
            latex init function

        4.  find way to automatically reparse document with
            `reftex-parse-all`{.verbatim} when building document -\>
            will ensure labels are updated for autocompletion as they
            are currently not refreshed -\> can be added to
            `company-reftex`{.verbatim}

        5.  think about improving workflow to handle spaces, make case
            unsensitive and parse bibliography codes better (eg.
            \"doran2017does\" from \"do\") in
            `company-reftex-citation-candidates`{.verbatim}, for
            development add package (eg.
            `(company-reftex :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "atreyasha/company-reftex"))`{.verbatim})
            in `dotspacemacs-additional-packages`{.verbatim} and update
            packages, delete old package location

    2.  emacs: fix wrong argument error on `helm-company`{.verbatim}
        post command hook -\> linked to `helm-company`{.verbatim}
        interaction with `company-post-command`{.verbatim}: see
        <https://github.com/Sodel-the-Vociferous/helm-company/issues/21>

    3.  system: find way to add system level dotfiles to repository and
        make shell script to separately initialize these without
        symlinking and instead via a copy command

    4.  i3: add capability to detect if headphones or speakers are on
        master -\> then print either headphones or speaker to status bar

2.  Long-term

    1.  emacs

        1.  fix slow response with `ipython`{.verbatim} inferior shell
            -\> related to general emacs text printing, see:
            <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/598/how-do-i-prevent-extremely-long-lines-making-emacs-slow/603>,
            <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/5545/how-to-prevent-slow-down-when-an-inferior-processes-generates-long-lines>

        2.  migrate to lightweight and lean personal emacs configuration
            which would be optimized with time such as with
            `doom`{.verbatim} -\> might help circumvent many bugs
            encountered such as those with `latex`{.verbatim} and
            `elpy`{.verbatim} compatibilities

        3.  consider changing to different autocompletion background
            such as `lsp`{.verbatim} to solve legacy issues

        4.  clean up `init.el`{.verbatim} and remove many comments

        5.  issue of `elpy`{.verbatim} hard-coded `company`{.verbatim}
            backends -\> this should instead be soft-coded and easily
            updated from upstream

        6.  work on script which updates all emacs packages during
            system update

        7.  consider running emacs as a service to have everything
            synchronized in one run

    2.  i3

        1.  flush screen when waking from sleep -\> execute
            `xset dpms force on`{.verbatim} hook perhaps with
            `sleep 1`{.verbatim} to overcome freeze bug

        2.  think about using xautolock/xss-lock to circumvent some
            manual pid checking and possibly extra sleep:
            <https://github.com/i3/i3lock/issues/275>

    3.  shell

        1.  consider using different configs for remote and local shells
            by sectioning into personal, core, etc

        2.  hook to shfmt on all shell scripts including zsh

        3.  special shell-check to ensure all shell tildes are replaced
            with \$HOME

        4.  bash: improve inputrc where possible and synchronize
            vim-mode with clipboard buffer -\> might be complicated

        5.  zsh/bash: improve shared history between multiple terminals
            and upon searches

            1.  first step for writing to common history file -\> zsh:
                `setopt shared_history`{.verbatim}, bash: extra prompt
                commands
                `PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a; history -c; history -r'`
                under `hooks`{.verbatim}

            2.  next step is reading from history file -\> either press
                enter, otherwise modify up and down keys to reload shell
                history before searches -\> see
                <https://superuser.com/questions/843138/how-can-i-get-zsh-shared-history-to-work/844048#844048>,
                but appears to bug out with 2-period oscillating
                searches in zsh

            3.  try with inc_append_history instread of shared_history,
                ignore this feature for bash and keep it only for zsh

    4.  mimeapps

        1.  synchronize mime system program defaults to same as
            ranger\'s rifle

    5.  ranger

        1.  make `rifle.conf`{.verbatim} and `scope.sh`{.verbatim}
            modular and additive as much as this is possible

    6.  system(d)

        1.  disable dpms/dim when video is playing: see bug report
            <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5504>

        2.  make scripts determine active \$DISPLAY environmental
            variable instead of hard-coding -\> use for cases where
            necessary

    7.  general

        1.  use pam environment to cache passphrase for ssh and gpg keys

        2.  port gnupg, ssh, neomutt private dotfiles to private stow
            repo

        3.  reduce the number of dotfiles for a leaner installation -\>
            for eg. remove `neofetch`{.verbatim}, etc.

### System reproducibility

1.  work on script which does manual update checks on
    `rifle.conf`{.verbatim}, `scope.sh`{.verbatim} and other
    emacs-hacked files which might require upstream updates -\> perhaps
    perform a diff framework to accept/reject upstream changes

2.  work on update script which updates all submodules and git repos to
    latest upstream commits eg.
    `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`{.verbatim}, and
    also updates misc. code bases such as melpa, vim, spacemacs, etc.

3.  work on install script which sets up all the necessary git repos for
    dotfiles that cannot be managed with submodules

## Completed

**DONE** bash/zsh: organize configurations files into modular
sub-files to be sourced by mains -\> difficult because of many different
functionalities in zsh but should be possible with enough scrutiny

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-25 Wed 00:47\]*

**DONE** i3: make all audio channels muted at boot (now only
main channel is muted) -\> very complicated because of pulseaudio and
alsa simultaneous actions:
<https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-utils/issues/72>, switch to single
volume value between different channels -\> will solve all of these
problems altogether -\> still challenging to solve

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-24 Tue 14:37\]*

symbols

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-22 Sun 14:02\]*

**DONE** bash/zsh: reduce redundant code in bash/zsh and

auto-completion and elpy -\> also improve general company autocompletion
flow and trigger it only on user request -\> need to understand
keybindings better to make this work

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-14 Sat 13:05\]*

**DONE** add user flags to pgrep i3lock cases -\> improve
other shell scripts too

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-12 Thu 14:46\]*

**DONE** clear shell output when logging out -\> useful for
ssh connections, see debian template -\> useful to have to override
existing default which may be confusing -\> don\'t do this

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-12 Thu 13:17\]*

**DONE** streamline and unify the usage of xsel and xclip -\>
decided to keep both options as both come in handy

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-12 Thu 12:57\]*

**DONE** fix tmux portability and xclip copy issues -\>
reverted to keep xsel

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-12 Thu 02:31\]*

.zshenv and somewhere important for bash -\> add if statement for logout
gpg-agent

**DONE** invest in a minimal tmux configuration file

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-11 Wed 19:48\]*

check for certain commands to reduce hard-coding (eg. ranger and
neomutt)

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-11 Wed 19:09\]*

**DONE** add upstream vim as submodule and then simply source
it cleanly + check if somehow possible for spacemacs too (change to
.spacemacs.d) -\> consider removing env file

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-10 Tue 15:31\]*

**DONE** add public ssh and gnupg dotfiles, find a way to
source additional file from ssh config

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-10 Tue 13:27\]*

-\> or make this leaner -\> lowercase all zshrc comments

**CLOSED:** *\[2020-11-10 Tue 02:37\]*
