## Tasks

### Next

1.  **TODO** Private

    1.  use private stow repository encrypted with git crypt

    2.  mbsyncrc, msmtp and individual account muttrcs

        1.  need to copy account and breaker pseudo-mailboxes

        2.  remove autogenerated comments later on when tracking

    3.  pass directory

    4.  gnupg keys

        1.  other important files such as sshcontrol -\> think of this
            meticulously

    5.  ssh host configs

        1.  think about whether these should be in private or public
            repo

    6.  abook

    7.  current dotfiles configuration mixes non-private user-specific
        and user-agnostic configurations

        1.  consider moving non-private user-specific configurations
            into private user-specific repository

        2.  might be more modular this way but will require re-thinking

        3.  (sub)keys are present in three cases: git, neomutt and pass

        4.  replace sourcing accounts.muttrc with an executable which
            searches for file, if not exits -\> port `accounts.muttrc`
            to private repo

        5.  move `gitd` dotfile folder to private repo as well

        6.  make UZH and UP emails fully archived and delete everything
            except archived directories (keep those as starting
            mailboxes)

    8.  find out how to handle master PGP key since this is a core
        dependency

        1.  central backup and maybe paperkey as well

2.  **TODO** Update management scripts

    1.  update script which updates all submodules and git repos to
        latest upstream commits eg. `make update` and then pushes
        upstream

    2.  update script for `emacs`, `vim` and `pip` packages

    3.  dump `pip --user` package lists as well during update -\>
        `pip freeze --user`

    4.  update script for package lists and all relevant logs on `monix`
        repo with `git push` afterwards

    5.  coordinate all of these processes with `monix` tasks

### Long-term

1.  Backup

    1.  reduce size of `personal` directory to keep only important data

    2.  optimize an elegant backup workflow of the `personal` directory
        with a script, possibly in the private repository

    3.  think of possible failures with wrong drive -\> perhaps would be
        good to have a reminder own notes instead of an automatic backup
        event

    4.  perhaps use tarballs with `rsync` to ensure only relevant data
        is updated

    5.  think of separating important and unimportant data -\> only back
        up the important data

    6.  organize drive to ensure backups all make good sense

2.  i3

    1.  port `i3-cycle` backend to `i3ipc` and ship everything to
        AUR/pypi: <https://github.com/mota/i3-cycle/issues/3>

    2.  replace `pypi` package(s) with this implementation

    3.  think about using xautolock/xss-lock to circumvent some manual
        pid checking and possibly extra sleep:
        <https://github.com/i3/i3lock/issues/207>

3.  Monitor configuration

    1.  create `AUR` repository for alternative package management:
        <https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr/issues/250>

    2.  replace `pypi` package with this implementation

4.  Neovim

    1.  Basic

        1.  migrate from vim to neovim to fix upstream issues related to
            `terminfo` and `alacritty`:
            <https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/919>

        2.  conditionally alias `nvim` to `vim` if it exists

        3.  conditional `xterm-256color` declaration inside `.vimrc` if
            `nvim` is not running

            1.  update variables referencing `xterm-256color` or `vim`
                in dotfiles if necessary

        4.  find good location to install `suda` plugin from `nvim` to
            overcome issue:
            <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12103>

    2.  Next

        1.  re-develop neovim configuration from the ground up by
            removing all unnecessary plugins

        2.  sort out a clean way of updating all plugins as necessary:
            <https://github.com/amix/vimrc/issues/637>

            1.  this is no longer be necessary since plugins are
                regularly updated upstream

5.  Emacs

    1.  Change emacs distribution

        1.  migrate to lightweight and lean personal emacs configuration
            which would be optimized with time such as with `doom` -\>
            might help circumvent many bugs encountered such as those
            with `latex` and `elpy` compatibilities

        2.  work on script which updates all emacs packages during
            system update

    2.  Patch `company-reftex`

        1.  think about improving workflow to handle spaces, make case
            unsensitive and parse bibliography codes better (eg.
            \"doran2017does\" from \"do\") in
            `company-reftex-citation-candidates`, for development add
            package (eg.
            `(company-reftex :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "atreyasha/company-reftex"))`)
            in `dotspacemacs-additional-packages` and update packages,
            delete old package location

    3.  Patch `helm-company`

        1.  fix wrong argument error on `helm-company` post command hook
            -\> linked to `helm-company` interaction with
            `company-post-command`: see
            <https://github.com/Sodel-the-Vociferous/helm-company/issues/21>
            -\> fix would require looking at `company-post-command` to
            understand what is failing

    4.  Patch `elpy`

        1.  issue of `elpy` hard-coded `company` backends -\> this
            should instead be soft-coded and easily updated from
            upstream

    5.  Spacemacs

        1.  Improve autocompletions of latex layer:
            <https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/14134>

            1.  wrong order of company-completions -\> brute-force
                solution is to create new layer

            2.  lighter solution is to modify `company-backends`
                variable post-initialization -\> perhaps with advice
                over latex init function

        2.  Automatically merge upstream changes to latex layer which
            are coped/modified

6.  Neomutt

    1.  issue of specified subkey not being used:
        <https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/2980>

    2.  update exact subkey when this is fixed

7.  PGP public key

    1.  host public key on `keys.openpgp.org`

    2.  add personal website page for accessing keys manually on GitHub
        or via specific keyserver (and mention not others)

8.  Mimeapps

    1.  synchronize mime system program defaults to same as ranger\'s
        rifle

9.  Qutebrowser

    1.  disable dpms/dim when video is playing: see bug report
        <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5504>

10. Generic

    1.  update configuration files with upstream changes (or remove
        upstream templates)

    2.  update script which does manual update checks on files which
        might require upstream updates -\> perhaps perform a diff
        framework to accept/reject upstream changes -\> eg. `spacemacs`
        latex layer modified files

    3.  examples include spacemacs and qutebrowser
